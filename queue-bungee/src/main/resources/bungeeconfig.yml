#by this plugin

#Queue notification that appears above a player's hotbar
ACTIONBAR:
  ENABLED: true
  TEXT: "You are in queue"

#Permission nodes
#Permissions assigned to a player will determine their priority in queue
#Note:
# - Normal queue priority currently requires no node (probably going to change)
# - Additionally, permissions are checked using bukkit server's permission plugin, not the proxy's bungee permissions
#
# If you are encountering an error with your permissions, ensure that the queue-bukkit.jar file is properly placed in
# your corresponding queue server's plugin folder, NOT the proxy's plugin folder

  PRIORITY:
    HIGH: "queue.priority.high"
